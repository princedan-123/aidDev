INSTALLATION

The following are instructions on how to install and set up the app, the app relies on Python Flask framework tools and all the necessary Flask extensions including external dependencies or services.
<ol>
<li>Get a free API key (Google Cloud)</li>
<li>For security reasons, save your key as an environment variable using this name 'google_api_key' in your config file 
<li>Clone the repo</li>

<li>Install the necessary packages by simply running the dependencies.sh script if you are using Linux or you may install them manually</li>
</ol>

USAGE

On the homepage of the project there is a search box, enter your search query in the search box, then select the type of material you want to be recommended from the menu, note that by default video is selected, and then click on the recommend button.
In order for you to get the best out of this application you should take note of the following points.
Your search query should be specific and limited to software engineering-related items.
It should also be noted that although Google APIs are free, they are quota-based.
Each time you enter a search query you are using the allocated quota and if it is exceeded you may get an error message.
